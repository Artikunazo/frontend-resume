I have a passion for problem-solving, collaboration, and proactive code management, which enable me to deliver high-impact technical solutions for various projects and clients. \n\nOne of my recent achievements was orchestrating the development and integration of value-enhancing features for a high-stakes B2B portal generating $100M in annual sales at Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. I used Angular to craft a seamless user experience and contribute to revenue growth. I also consistently delivered quality web applications utilizing modern web technologies and dynamic data integration via APIs at HCLTech. My goal is to continue learning and growing as a frontend engineer, and get experience as a fullstack developer with NestJS.",
